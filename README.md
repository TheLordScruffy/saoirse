# Saoirse Launcher

Saoirse is a (WIP) portable Wii homebrew project for launching games under a modified IOS firmware. The project aims to eventually become a user-friendly launcher for game modifications.

## Planned Features

Without any requirement for installation or modification to the Wii console itself, Saoirse hopes to provide the following:

* Game file replacement.
* Save data redirection.
* Support for patch configuration and module formats (such as [Riivolution](https://github.com/AerialX/rawksd), [Brainslug](https://github.com/Chadderz121/brainslug-wii)).
* Game backup loading.
